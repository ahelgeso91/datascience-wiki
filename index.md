**MOOCs**

There are a couple of really excellent online lectures to get you started.
The list is too long to include them all. Every one of the major MOOC sites offers
not only one but several good Machine Learning classes, so please check
 [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), 
 [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) yourself to see which ones are interesting to you.

Below are a few that stand out, either because they are introductory courses, they're very popular, or are done by people who are famous for their work in machine learning. Roughly in order from easiest to hardest:

* [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359): The Introduction to Data Science class will survey the foundational topics in data science, namely: Data Manipulation, Data Analysis with Statistics and Machine Learning, Data Communication with Information Visualization, & Data at Scale -- Working with Big Data.

* [Data Analysis with R](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651): Exploratory data analysis is an approach for summarizing and visualizing the important characteristics of a data set. Promoted by John Tukey, exploratory data analysis focuses on exploring data to understand the dataâ€™s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, to consider how that data set came into existence, and to decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods.

* Andrew Ng's [ML-Class at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml): Focused on application of techniques. Easy to understand, but mathematically very shallow. Good for beginners!

* Hastie/Tibshirani's [Statistical Learning](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about): Aimed at beginners and as a precursor to their "Elements of Statistical Learning" class.

* Hastie/Tibshirani's [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/): Also aimed at beginners and focused more on applications.

* Yaser Abu-Mostafa's [Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/caltechx-cs1156x-learning-data-1120):
 Focuses a lot more on theory, but also doable for beginners
