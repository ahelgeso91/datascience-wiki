## How to Become a Data Scientist

The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  

1. Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
2. Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
3. Getting related work experience through technical internships.  

All three require a significant time and financial commitment.

## Salary

Most people are attracted to data science for the salary. It's true that data scientists garner high salaries comparies to their peers. There is data to support this: The May 2018 edition of the [BurtchWorks Data Science Salary Survey](https://www.burtchworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Burtch-Works-Study_DS-2018.pdf),annual salary statistics were

## Demographics

### Education

Data scientists are highly educated. With exceedingly rare exception, every data scientist holds at least an undergraduate degree. 91% of data scientists in 2018 held advanced degrees. The remaining 9% all held undergraduate degrees. Furthermore,  

> - 25% of data scientists hold a degree in statistics or mathematics,  
> - 20% have a computer science degree,  
> - an additional 20% hold a degree in the natural sciences, and  
> - 18% hold an engineering degree.  

The remaining 17% of surveyed data scientists held degrees in business, social science, or economics.

### Gender

22% of surveyed entry-level data scientists identify as women. Across all experience levels, only 15% of data scientists identify as women.  

### Years Experience

The profession is young: the median data scientist has only 6 years relevant experience, and "72% have 10 or fewer years" experience.  

### US Citizenship

Per the Burtch Works study, non-US citizens are commonly employed as data scientists in the US: "nearly half of data scientists are not US citizens."
