### What Is a Data Scientist?

> Data scientists apply sophisticated quantitative and computer science skills to both structure and analyze massive stores or continuous streams of unstructured data, with the intent to derive insights and prescribe action.

### How to Become a Data Scientist

The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  

1. Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
2. Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
3. Getting related work experience through technical internships.  

All three require a significant time and financial commitment.

### Salary

Most people are attracted to data science for the salary. It's true that data scientists garner high salaries comparies to their peers. There is data to support this: The May 2018 edition of the [BurtchWorks Data Science Salary Survey](https://www.burtchworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Burtch-Works-Study_DS-2018.pdf),annual salary statistics were  

|Title|25<sup>th</sup> Percentile|50<sup>th</sup> Percentile|75<sup>th</sup> Percentile|N|  
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|  
|Entry-Level Data Scientist |  $80,000 |  $95,000 | $110,000 |  97|  
|Mid-Level Data Scientist   | $114,055 | $128,750 | $144,500 | 107|  
|Senior Data Scientist      | $150,000 | $165,000 | $194,000 |  47|  

Note the above numbers do not reflect total compensation.  

### Demographics

#### Education

Data scientists are highly educated. With exceedingly rare exception, every data scientist holds at least an undergraduate degree. 91% of data scientists in 2018 held advanced degrees. The remaining 9% all held undergraduate degrees. Furthermore,  

> - 25% of data scientists hold a degree in statistics or mathematics,  
> - 20% have a computer science degree,  
> - an additional 20% hold a degree in the natural sciences, and  
> - 18% hold an engineering degree.  

The remaining 17% of surveyed data scientists held degrees in business, social science, or economics.

#### Gender

22% of surveyed entry-level data scientists identify as women. Across all experience levels, only 15% of data scientists identify as women.  

#### Years Experience

The profession is young: the median data scientist has only 6 years relevant experience, and "72% have 10 or fewer years" experience.  

#### US Citizenship

Per the Burtch Works study, non-US citizens are commonly employed as data scientists in the US: "nearly half of data scientists are not US citizens."
