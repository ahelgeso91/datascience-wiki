# Data Science Lifecycle

This page is organized around four milestones shared by every practising data scientist:

1. __Aware__. I've heard of data science. I want to learn more about it.

2. __Learning__. I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

3. __Searching__. I'm looking for my first DS job.

4. __Employed__. I work in data science and I am looking for ways to improve.
