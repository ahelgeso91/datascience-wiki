        Welcome to this week's 'Entering & Transitioning' thread!  

        This thread is a weekly sticky post meant for any questions about getting started, studying, or transitioning into the data science field. This includes questions around learning and transitioning such as:  

        * Learning resources (e.g., books, tutorials, videos)  
        * Traditional education (e.g., schools, degrees, electives)  
        * Alternative education (e.g., online courses, bootcamps)  
        * Career questions (e.g., resumes, applying, career prospects)  
        * Elementary questions (e.g., where to start, what next)  

        While you're waiting for answers, check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/frequently-asked-questions) and [Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/resources) pages on our wiki.
