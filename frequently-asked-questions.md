# Frequently Asked Questions

Questions are briefly answered and followed by a curated list of relevant threads and answers. The curated resources are sometimes annotated for clarity.  

This page is organized around four milestones shared by every practising data scientist:

1. __Aware__. I've heard of data science. I want to learn more about it.

2. __Learning__. I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

3. __Searching__. I'm looking for my first DS job.

4. __Employed__. I work in data science and I am looking for ways to improve. 

It goes without saying, but we'll say it here, the brief answers speak to the general case unless otherwise stated. Special cases are answered in the curated resources.

This page is currently under development. Check back in periodically as content as added.

### How Are Data Scientists Different From Data Analysts?

Broadly speaking, the roles differ in scope: data analysts build reports with narrow, well-defined KPIs. Data scientists often to work on broader business problems without clear solutions. Data scientists live on the edge of the known and unknown.

We'll leave you with a concrete example: A data analyst cares about profit margins. A data scientist at the same company cares about market share.

### Is It True That Data Scientists Earn a Lot of Money?

Most people are attracted to data science for the salary. It's true that data scientists garner high salaries comparies to their peers. There is data to support this: The May 2018 edition of the BurtchWorks Data Science Salary Survey, annual salary statistics were  

|Title|25th Percentile|50th Percentile|75th Percentile|N|  
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|  
|Entry-Level Data Scientist |  $80,000 |  $95,000 | $110,000 |  97|  
|Mid-Level Data Scientist   | $114,055 | $128,750 | $144,500 | 107|  
|Senior Data Scientist      | $150,000 | $165,000 | $194,000 |  47|  

Note the above numbers do not reflect total compensation which often includes standard benefits and may include company ownership at high levels.

## Learning

> I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

### How do I become a Data Scientist?

The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  

1. Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
2. Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
3. Getting related work experience through technical internships.  

All three require a significant time and financial commitment.

There used to be a saying around /r/datascience: The road into a data science starts with two years of university-level math.

### Should I Go to Grad School?

> If you can find a job doing data-related work that you enjoy, don't go to grad school; continue to work and teach yourself whatever you need (or want) to learn.  
> If you are not being considered for jobs that you actually want to do - and the reason is that you don't have a background that is classically found in data science - then you may want to consider grad school as a safer route to be qualified for said jobs.
