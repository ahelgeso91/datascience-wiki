# Frequently Asked Questions

This page is organized around four milestones shared by every practising data scientist:

1. __Aware__. I've heard of data science. I want to learn more about it.

2. __Learning__. I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

3. __Searching__. I'm looking for my first DS job.

4. __Employed__. I work in data science and I am looking for ways to improve.

### Should I Go to Grad School?

> If you can find a job doing data-related work that you enjoy, don't go to grad school; continue to work and teach yourself whatever you need (or want) to learn.  
> If you are not being considered for jobs that you actually want to do - and the reason is that you don't have a background that is classically found in data science - then you may want to consider grad school as a safer route to be qualified for said jobs.
