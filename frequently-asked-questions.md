# Frequently Asked Questions

Questions are briefly answered and followed by a curated list of relevant threads and answers. The curated resources are sometimes annotated for clarity. __Resources are free__ unless otherwise stated. 

This page is organized around four milestones shared by every practising data scientist:

1. __Aware__. I've heard of data science. I want to learn more about it.

2. __Learning__. I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

3. __Searching__. I'm looking for my first DS job.

4. __Employed__. I work in data science and I am looking for ways to improve. 

It goes without saying, but we'll say it here, the brief answers speak to the general case unless otherwise stated. Special cases are answered in the curated resources.

This page is currently under development. Check back in periodically as content as added.

## Aware

> I've heard of data science. I want to learn more about it.  

### What Is a Data Scientist?

> Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.  
> \- [Josh Wills](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656?lang=en)

> Data scientists apply sophisticated quantitative and computer science skills to both structure and analyze massive stores or continuous streams of unstructured data, with the intent to derive insights and prescribe action.  
> \- [Burtch Works Data Science Salary Survey, May 2018](https://www.burtchworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Burtch-Works-Study_DS-2018.pdf)

> More than anything, what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data... In a competitive landscape where challenges keep changing and data never stop flowing, data scientists help decision makers shift from ad hoc analysis to an ongoing conversation with data.

### Do All Data Scientists Hold Graduate Degrees?

Data scientists are highly educated. With exceedingly rare exception, every data scientist holds at least an undergraduate degree. 91% of data scientists in 2018 held advanced degrees. The remaining 9% all held undergraduate degrees. Furthermore,  

> - 25% of data scientists hold a degree in statistics or mathematics,  
> - 20% have a computer science degree,  
> - an additional 20% hold a degree in the natural sciences, and  
> - 18% hold an engineering degree.  

The remaining 17% of surveyed data scientists held degrees in business, social science, or economics.

### How Are Data Scientists Different From Data Analysts?

Broadly speaking, the roles differ in scope: data analysts build reports with narrow, well-defined KPIs. Data scientists often to work on broader business problems without clear solutions. Data scientists live on the edge of the known and unknown.

We'll leave you with a concrete example: A data analyst cares about profit margins. A data scientist at the same company cares about market share.

## Learning

> I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

### How do I become a Data Scientist?

The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  

1. Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
2. Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
3. Getting related work experience through technical internships.  

All three require a significant time and financial commitment.

There used to be a saying around /r/datascience: The road into a data science starts with two years of university-level math.

### How Do I Learn...

__How Do I Learn Python?__

If you don't know the first thing about programming, start with MIT's course in the curated list.

These modules are the standard tools for data analysis in Python:

- `pandas` (and by extension, `numpy`)
    - Check out [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/alhmp1/minimally_sufficient_pandas/) for style guides and best practices.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
    - [See /u/rhiever's response to How do you decide between the plotting libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4tuwoz/how_do_you_decide_between_the_plotting_libraries/d5kyyk6)
    - Don't worry about bokeh or dash unless you have a personal interest in interactive visualizations.
- `scipy` and `scikit-learn`
    - Internalize the `.fit()` and `.predict()` pattern.

    - Related to pythonprogramming.net  
4. /r/learnpython is an active sub and very useful for learning the basics.

__How Do I Learn R?__

If you don't know the first thing about programming, start with R for Data Science in the curated list.

These modules are the standard tools for data analysis in Python:

__Curated Resources__

1. [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    - A free ebook full of succinct code examples. Terrific for learning tidyverse syntax.
    - Folks with some math background may prefer the free alternative, [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  
2. [Data Scientist with R Career Track | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r)
    - The first courses are free, but unlimited access costs $29/month. Users usually report a positive experience, and it's one of the few hands-on ways to learn R.
3. [R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
    - Learners with a CS background will appreciate this free handbook explaining how and why R behaves the way that it does.  

__How Do I Learn SQL?__

Prioritize the basics of SQL. i.e. when to use functions like `POW`, `SUM`, `RANK`; the computational complexity of the different kinds of joins.

Concepts like relational algebra, when to use clustered/non-clustered indexes, etc. are useful, but (almost) never come up in interviews. 

You absolutely do not need to understand administrative concepts like managing permissions.

Finally, [there are numerous query engines](https://i.imgur.com/WIIHmmm.mp4) and therefore numerous dialects of SQL. Use whichever dialect is supported in your chosen resource. There's not much difference between them, so it's easy to learn another dialect after you've learned one.

### Should I Go to Grad School?

/u/drhorn said it best in [Want to pursue career in Data Science, need advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6gqx2q/want_to_pursue_career_in_data_science_need_advice/dit1zkx):

> If you can find a job doing data-related work that you enjoy, don't go to grad school; continue to work and teach yourself whatever you need (or want) to learn.  
> If you are not being considered for jobs that you actually want to do - and the reason is that you don't have a background that is classically found in data science - then you may want to consider grad school as a safer route to be qualified for said jobs.

### What does the typical data science interview process look like?

For general advice, [Mastering the DS Interview Loop](https://towardsdatascience.com/mastering-the-data-science-interview-15f9c0a558a7) is a terrific article. The community [discussed the article here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/air0nf/mastering_the_data_science_interview_loop/).  

Briefly summarized, most companies follow a five stage process:  

1. Coding Challenge  
    - Most common at software companies and roles contributing to a digital product.  
2. HR Screen  
3. Technical Screen  
    - Often in the form of a project. Less frequently, it takes the form of a whiteboarding session at the onsite.  
4. Onsite  
    - Usually the project from the technical screen is presented here, followed by a meeting with the director overseeing the team you'll join.  
5. Negotiation & Offer  

Advice specific to Facebook, Zillow, and other companies follows below.
